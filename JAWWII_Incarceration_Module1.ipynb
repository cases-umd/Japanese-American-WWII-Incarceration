    "\n",
    "Data manipuation is the process of fine tuning data to organize and prepare the data for research purposes. Data manipulation can include sorting, filtering, cleaning, normalizing, and joining separate datasets. Once the data has been prepared, data analysis can be perfomed. According to the Office of Research Integrity, \"Data Analysis is the process of systematically applying statistical and/or logical techniques to describe and illustrate, condense and recap, and evaluate data.\" Below are the steps performed for data manipulation and analysis process using Python programming language on the Japanese American World War II datasets. The modules are split into two parts - Part 1 and Part 2."

    "We anticipated errors and misinterpretation of names, numbers, etc. in the data since these databases were either transcribed manually or physical copies digitized using OCR techniques. We approached this by individually exploring and cleaning the selected columns using the text and numerical operation functions in Python. To begin, we looked at the datasets holistically to identify variables that would allow for us to generate meaningful stories and visualizations. After a list of variables were confirmed, we analyzed each of them in detail to document bad data and eliminate them if possible, modify data types, exclude them from the final visualizations if found to be invalid, etc.\n",

For example, at times it was difficult to determine the order of a persons first and last name as well as many of the names are similiar to one another with one or two characters being different. Keeping this in mind, we have to be conscientious we are looking at the correct individual(s). A method for doing this is comparing information across the three separate data files like age, residence, family, individual or alien registration number, or using details found in the Other column. At other times we found that information was incomplete, for example, the WRA has truncated last names, leaving us to deduce that we were looking at the correct person after comparing the previously mentioned fields. \n",

This was a phenomena discovered by simply becoming familiar with the data. In fact, George was not the only individual to use an evangelical name during incarceration. Now that we are equipped with this information, this will require us to do further investigation so we are careful not to rule out a person because their doesnt immediately appear in a dataset. It may end up being the case here where an alternative name is used."
